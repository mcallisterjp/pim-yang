        This document defines a YANG data model that can be used to configure
        Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) devices.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        YANG <xref target="RFC6020"/> <xref target="RFC6087"/> is a data
        definition language that was introduced to model the configuration
        and running state of a device managed using NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"/>.
        YANG is now also being used as a component of wider management
        interfaces, such as CLIs.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document defines a draft YANG data model that can be used to
        configure and manage Protocol-Independent Multicast (PIM) devices.
        Currently this model is incomplete, but it will support the core PIM
        protocol, as well as many other features mentioned in separate PIM RFCs.
        Non-core features are defined as optional in the provided data model.
      </t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>
          The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
          "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and
          "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
          BCP 14, RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Terminology">
        <t>
          The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in
          <xref target="RFC6020"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          This draft employs YANG tree diagrams, which are explained in
          <xref target="I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc6087bis"/>.
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Design of Data Model">
      <section title="Scope of model">
        <t>
          The model covers PIM Sparse Mode <xref target="RFC4601"/>, including the
          Source-Specfic subset <xref target="RFC3569"/>, Dense Mode
          <xref target="RFC3973"/>, and Bi-directional PIM <xref target="RFC5015"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          The PIM extensions represented in the model include BSR
          <xref target="RFC5059"/> and Anycast RP <xref target="RFC4610"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          The representation of some of these features is not completely specified
          in this draft of the data model. This model is being circulated in its
          current form for early oversight and review of the basic hierarchy.
        </t>
        <t>
          The operational state fields and notifications of this model are also
          incomplete, though the structure of what has been written may be taken as
          representative of the structure of the model when complete.
        </t>
        <t>
          This model does not cover other multicast protocols such as IGMP/MLD,
          MSDP, mVPN, or m-LDP in-band signalling. It does not cover any configuration
          required to generate the MRIB. These will be covered by future Internet Drafts.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Optional capabilities">
        <t>
          This model is designed to represent the capabilities of PIM devices
          with various specifications, including some with basic subsets of the
          PIM protocol. The main design goals of this draft are that any major
          now-existing implementation may be said to support the base model, and
          that the configuration of all implementations meeting the specification
          is easy to express through some combination of the features in the base
          model and simple vendor augmentations.
        </t>
        <t>
          There is also value in widely-supported features being standardized, to
          save work for individual vendors, and so that mapping between different
          vendors' configuration is not needlessly complicated. Therefore these
          modules declare a number of features representing capabilities that
          not all deployed devices support.
        </t>
        <t>
          The extensive use of feature declarations should also substantially
          simplify the capability negotiation process for a vendor's PIM
          implementation.
        </t>
        <t>
          On the other hand, operational state parameters are not so widely
          designated as features, as there are many cases where the defaulting
          of an operational state parameter would not cause any harm to the
          system, and it is much more likely that an implementation without
          native support for a piece of operational state would be able to
          derive a suitable value for a state variable that is not natively
          supported.
        </t>
        <t>
          For the same reason, wide constant ranges (for example, timer maxima
          and minima) will be used in the model. It is expected that vendors will
          augment the model with any specific restrictions that might be
          required. Vendors may also extend the features list with proprietary
          extensions.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Top-level structure">
        <t>
          This model defines several separate modules for modelling PIM
          configuration, defined below. Again, this separation will make it
          easier to express the specific capabilities of a PIM device.
        </t>
        <t>
          The hierarchy of PIM configuration is designed so that objects that
          are only relevant for one situation or feature are collected in a
          container for that feature. For example, the configuration for PIM-SM
          that is not relevant for an SSM-only implementation is collected in an
          ASM container.
        </t>
        <t>
          Where fields are not genuinely essential to protocol operation, they
          are marked as optional. Some fields will be essential but have a
          default specified, so they need not be explicitly configured.
        </t>
        <t>
          This module structure also applies, where applicable, to the operational
          state and notifications of the model.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Position of address family in hierarchy">
        <t>
          The current draft contains address-family as a node in the hierarchy
          multiple times: both under the interface list, and under the PIM instance.
          This is similar to the IS-IS yang draft model.
        </t>
        <t>
          The reasoning for this is to make it easier for implementations in which
          configuration options are not supported for specific address families.
        </t>
        <t>
          For these implementations, the restriction that interface configuration
          must be address-family independent must either be expressed as a vendor
          augmentation of an address-family-independent parameter above the
          address-family level, or by a constraint on the base model objects of a
          form similar to:
        </t>
        <t>
          must “. = ../../address-family[address-family='ipv4']/
            interface[interface=current()/sibling:interface]/dr-priority” {
            error-app-tag dr-priority-mismatch;
            error-message "Error: IPv6 DR priority must match IPv4 DR priority ";
          }
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Unresolved Issues">
      <section title="Current status of work in progress">
        <t>
          The model so far details how the PIM modules interact and covers the
          higher levels of their hierarchy. Some details of interface configuration,
          RP configuration, and PIM-ASM-specific parameters are also complete.
        </t>
        <t>
          For a list of the most substantial areas still to cover, please see the
          "TODO list" section below.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Group range mappings">
        <t>
          There is currently no convenient way in the operational state model to
          map from a group address to the PIM mode and RP information that it
          will be forwarded according to, which complicates reasoning about the
          running state and the diagnosis of conflicting policy configuration.
        </t>
        <t>
          A hypothetical group range state reporting object indexed by group range
          would be desirable for this purpose, but would be inconvenient for many
          implementations that index the relevant information on RP address (not
          applicable for DM or unroutable group-ranges), and difficult to express
          directly in YANG (as it is difficult to express a container indexed on
          an arbitrary, proprietary policy structure).
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Issues blocked on other model designers">
        <t>
          Some questions must be resolved with reference to other yang models, and so
          the resolution may be blocked on a decision from another body. Currently
          these issues are:
          <list style='numbers'>
            <t>
              The position of BFD in the configuration; does the BFD model augment
              various different protocols, or do the protocols have to augment
              themselves individually to support BFD?
            </t>
            <t>
              The abstract concepts of a "set of IP addresses" or "set of IP
              prefixes", as represented in implementations by prefixes, ACLs or
              policy statements, is a general concept out of the scope of this
              document. It will presumably have a yang data-type the instantiation
              of which is vendor-specific.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Module Structure">
      <section title="PIM base module">
        <t>
          The PIM base module defines the router-wide configuration options not
          specific to any PIM mode, and is included by the other modules. There
          are a couple of things worth mentioning here regarding where the PIM
          model fits in the overall routing hierarchy:
          <list style='numbers'>
            <t>
              Our current direction is to agree to a routing-instance-centric (VRF)
              model as opposed to protocol-centric mainly because it fits well into
              the routing-instance model, and it is easier to map from the VRF-centric
              to the protocol-centric than the other way around due to forward
              references.
            </t>
            <t>
              The PIM base model will augment "/rt:routing/rt:routing-instance/
              rt:routing-protocols:” as opposed to augmenting "/rt:routing/
              rt:routing-instance/rt:routing-protocols:/rt:routing-protocol” as the
              latter would allow multiple protocol instances per VRF, which does not
              make sense for PIM.

        In this draft, several aspects of the model are incomplete. The PIM-DM
        and BI-DIR modules are just placeholders for now to demonstrate the
