        This document defines a YANG data model that can be used to configure
        Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) devices.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        YANG <xref target="RFC6020"/> <xref target="RFC6087"/> is a data
        definition language that was introduced to model the configuration
        and running state of a device managed using NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"/>.
        YANG is now also being used as a component of wider management
        interfaces, such as CLIs.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document defines a draft YANG data model that can be used to
        configure and manage Protocol-Independent Multicast (PIM) devices.
        Currently this model is incomplete, but it will support the core PIM
        protocol, as well as many other features mentioned in separate PIM RFCs.
        Non-core features are defined as optional in the provided data model.
      </t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>
          The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
          "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and
          "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
          BCP 14, RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Terminology">
        <t>
          The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in 
          <xref target="RFC6020"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          This draft employs YANG tree diagrams, which are explained in
          <xref target="I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc6087bis"/>.
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Design of Data Model">
      <section title="Scope of model">
        <t>
          The model covers PIM Sparse Mode <xref target="RFC4601"/>, including the 
          Source-Specfic subset <xref target="RFC3569"/>, Dense Mode
          <xref target="RFC3973"/>, and Bi-directional PIM <xref target="RFC5015"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          The PIM extensions represented in the model include BSR
          <xref target="RFC5059"/> and Anycast RP <xref target="RFC4610"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          The representation of some of these features is not completely specified 
          in this draft of the data model. This model is being circulated in its
          current form for early oversight and review of the basic hierarchy.
        </t>
        <t>
          This model does not cover other multicast protocols such as IGMP/MLD or
          MSDP. It does not cover any configuration required to generate the MRIB.
          These will be covered by future Internet Drafts.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Optional capabilities">
        <t>
          This model is designed to represent the capabilities of PIM devices
          with various specifications, including some with basic subsets of the
          PIM protocol. Since a design goal of this draft is to define a data
          model that is capable of representing all of these implementations,
          these modules declare a number of features representing capabilities
          that not all deployed devices support.
        </t>
        <t>
          The extensive use of feature declarations should substantially
          simplify the capability negotiation process for a vendor's PIM 
          implementation.
        </t>
        <t>
          For the same reason, wide constant ranges (for example, timer maxima
          and minima) will be used in the model. It is expected that vendors will
          augment the model with any specific restrictions that might be 
          required. Vendors may also extend the features list with proprietary
          extensions.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Top-level structure">
        <t>
          This model defines several separate modules for modelling PIM
          configuration, defined below. Again, this separation will make it 
          easier to express the specific capabilities of a PIM device.
        </t>
        <t>
          The hierarchy of PIM configuration is designed so that objects that
          are only relevant for one situation or feature are collected in a
          container for that feature. For example, the configuration for PIM-SM
          that is not relevant for an SSM-only implementation is collected in an
          ASM container.
        </t>
        <t>
          Where fields are not genuinely essential to protocol operation, they
          are marked as optional. Some fields will be essential but have a
          default specified, so they need not be explicitly configured.
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Unresolved Issues">
      <section title="Current status of work in progress">
        <t>
          The model so far details how the PIM modules interact and covers the
          higher levels of their hierarchy. Some details of interface configuration,
          RP configuration, and PIM-ASM-specific parameters are also complete.
        </t>
        <t>
          For a list of the most substantial areas still to cover, please see the
          "TODO list" section below.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Position of address family in hierarchy">
        <t>
          The current draft has an address-family container at a high level in
          the hierarchy of the model, with an interface list as a child object.
          There is ongoing discussion about this decision in the design team, so
          this may be considered unresolved.
        </t>
        <t>
          The advantages of the current position are that interface objects
          effectively represent {interface, address-family} pairs, which is in 
          line with several existing implementations. Expressing interface-scoped 
          configuration that is also address family dependent is made much easier
          using this model.
        </t>
        <t>
          It also may be useful to be able to configure router-wide options on an 
          address-family basis, which would be highly inconvenient if address
          family were a child object of the interface list. At least one deployed
          implementation allows configuration of basic router-scoped concepts on 
          an address family basis.
        </t>
        <t>
          The main disadvantage is that implementations that configure interfaces
          on an address-family-independent basis with one set of configuration
          must express this restriction somehow. This can be done via a
          vendor-specific augmentation, as above, or in other ways. This
          modification is expected to be easier and simpler than the converse 
          modification to the alternative mode, to create address-family-scoped
          interface configuration.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="RP configuration tree">
        <t>
          This draft of the model provides a module (currently called pim-rp)
          which is used for group range mapping configuration. Though some of 
          this configuration is only relevant for some PIM modes, the pim-rp
          structure itself is independent of the PIM mode structures. 
        </t>
        <t>
          The main advantage of this structure is that it substantially 
          simplifies the representation of the mapping algorithm from a specific
          group address to its PIM mode and configuration. Validation is also 
          easier, as only the pim-rp module itself needs to be checked if there
          is another entry with a conflicting or inconsistent group prefix.
        </t>
        <t>
          There are also some advantages to this approach in non-duplication of
          configuration parameters that are specific to multiple PIM modes, such 
          as BSR.
        </t>
        <t>
          The current name of this module is pim-rp, as it is roughly analogous
          to the pimStaticRPTable in the PIM MIB. However, as it is used for 
          some group-range-scoped configuration not directly related to RPs, 
          a better name might be something like pim-group-mapping. This is still
          under discussion.

        <t>
          The PIM RP module contains configuration information scoped to 
          ranges of group addresses. This does not belong in the hierarchy
          under any PIM mode, as it is how group ranges are assigned to PIM
          modes.
        </t>
        <t>
          Some of the content of the module, however, is only relevant to some
          modes (for example, BSR is only relevant to ASM and BIDIR). This is 
          clarified in the module itself using "if-feature" and "when" statements.

    <section title="TODO list">
      <t>
        In this draft, several aspects of the model are incomplete. The PIM-DM
        and BI-DIR modules are just placeholders for now to demonstrate the 
        hierarchy of the model. Other things the draft will include when
        complete but does not yet include:
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>
            State reporting
          </t>
          <t>
            Notifications
          </t>
          <t>
            Neighbor configuration
          </t>
          <t>
            Constraints (constant ranges, validation)
          </t>
          <t>
            State-limiting and policy.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        For these subjects, we will employ the same design principles of
        expressing a highly general model; vendors may use features and add
        augmentations in order to express which subsets of this general model
        are valid in their implementations.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
        The data model defined does not introduce any security implications.
      </t>
      <t>
        This draft does not change any underlying security issues inherent in
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-netmod-routing-cfg"/>.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>
        TBD
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title='Acknowledgements'>
      <t>
